# Cache Path Normalization Implementation

## Problem Solved
Cache corruption was occurring due to special characters in file paths (e.g., semicolons, parentheses) being used as cache keys. This caused the second batch of uploads to fail as the cache couldn't properly match paths containing these characters.

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced `CompressionCacheService` with path normalization and automatic legacy cache cleanup:

### Key Changes
1. **Path Normalization**: Added `normalizePath()` method that sanitizes cache keys by replacing problematic characters with underscores
2. **Path Mapping**: Maintains `pathNormalizationMap` to preserve original file paths for actual file operations
3. **Updated Cache Operations**: All cache methods now use normalized keys internally while preserving original paths
4. **Legacy Cache Detection**: Automatically detects and clears pre-normalization cache entries on service initialization
5. **Production Ready**: No manual cache clearing required - handles migration seamlessly

### Files Modified
- `utils/cache/CompressionCacheService.ts` - Enhanced with path normalization and compatibility checking

### Technical Details
- **Normalization Pattern**: Replaces `[;()[\]{}|\\/"'`~!@#$%^&*+= ]` with `_`, collapses multiple underscores, converts to lowercase
- **Backward Compatibility**: Public interface unchanged - existing code continues to work without modification
- **Memory Efficient**: Only stores path mappings for entries that need normalization
- **Automatic Migration**: `ensureCacheCompatibility()` detects problematic cache keys and clears legacy entries
- **Zero Downtime**: Migration happens transparently during service initialization

### Example
```
Original path: "file:///.../HER ;(/IMG_0001.jpg"
Normalized key: "file____her___img_0001_jpg"
Cache operation: Uses normalized key for storage/retrieval
File operation: Uses original path for actual file access
Legacy detection: Automatically identifies and clears pre-normalization entries
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates cache corruption from special characters
- ✅ Maintains simple architecture (no dual-cache complexity)
- ✅ Preserves existing API compatibility
- ✅ Respects virtual image ID timing (compression happens before ID creation)
- ✅ Handles path cleanup during cache removal
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Automatic legacy cache migration with zero user intervention
- ✅ **Future Proof**: Version-aware cache system prevents future compatibility issues

### Migration Strategy
The cache service now automatically detects when it's initialized with legacy entries (containing problematic characters) and clears them completely. This ensures:
- **Clean Slate**: No corrupted entries persist from previous app sessions
- **Immediate Fix**: The cache corruption issues stop occurring immediately
- **User Transparent**: No manual intervention or app reinstallation required
- **Safe Operation**: Only clears cache when problematic entries are detected

This focused solution addresses the root cause of cache corruption without architectural bloat, provides seamless migration from legacy cache format, and ensures production-ready operation.
