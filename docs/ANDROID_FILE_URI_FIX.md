# Android File URI Validation Fix

## Issue Summary
The application was failing to process images on Android due to overly strict path validation that was rejecting valid Android file URIs like:
```
file:///storage/9C33-6BBD/Alyssa/New folder/20240909_011554.jpg
```

## Root Causes
1. **File URI Handling**: The validator didn't properly recognize `file://` URIs as valid Android paths
2. **Space Character Rejection**: Folder names with spaces (like "New folder") were being flagged as problematic
3. **Android Path Requirements**: The validator was incorrectly requiring all Android paths to start with `/` even for file URIs

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced File URI Support
Updated `MobilePathValidator.validateMobilePath()` to:
- Properly detect and handle `file://` URIs
- Strip the `file://` prefix for validation but preserve URI structure
- Recognize `content://` URIs as valid Android content provider paths
- Skip absolute path requirements for file URIs

### 2. Relaxed Space Handling
- Removed spaces from the "problematic characters" list
- Only flag spaces as issues when they're leading/trailing in filenames
- Preserve spaces in folder names as they're common in user-created folders
- Updated sanitization to be less aggressive with space replacement

### 3. Auto-Fix Integration
Enhanced the MLKitManager to:
- Attempt automatic path fixing before failing validation
- Retry validation with fixed paths
- Log fix attempts for debugging
- Preserve original error information when fixes fail

### 4. Improved Error Context
- Better logging with filename-only paths for privacy
- Clearer distinction between file URI and regular path issues
- More specific error messages and suggestions

## Technical Changes

### MobilePathValidator.ts
```typescript
// Before: Rejected all paths not starting with /
if (path.length > 0 && !path.startsWith('/')) {
  issues.push('Android path should start with /');
}

// After: Handle file URIs properly
if (path.startsWith('file://')) {
  isFileUri = true;
  actualPath = path.substring(7);
} else if (path.startsWith('content://')) {
  return { isValid: true, issues: [], suggestions: [], platform };
}

if (!isFileUri && actualPath.length > 0 && !actualPath.startsWith('/')) {
  issues.push('Android path should start with / (unless using file:// URI)');
}
```

### Character Validation
```typescript
// Before: Spaces were problematic
const problematicChars = this.MOBILE_PROBLEMATIC_CHARS[platform];

// After: Allow spaces in paths
const problematicChars = /[<>:"|?*\x00-\x1f]/g; // Removed space
```

### MLKitManager.ts
```typescript
// Added auto-fix retry logic
if (!validationResult.accessible) {
  const fixedPath = FileValidator.attemptPathFix(imagePath);
  
  if (fixedPath && fixedPath !== imagePath) {
    const retryValidation = await FileValidator.validateFile(fixedPath);
    if (retryValidation.accessible) {
      imagePath = fixedPath; // Use fixed path for processing
    }
  }
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Valid Paths (Should Work)
✅ `file:///storage/9C33-6BBD/Alyssa/New folder/20240909_011554.jpg`
✅ `content://media/external/images/media/12345`
✅ `/storage/emulated/0/DCIM/Camera/IMG_20240909_011554.jpg`
✅ Folder names with spaces like "New folder", "My Photos", etc.

### Invalid Paths (Should Still Fail)
❌ Filenames with: `< > : " | ? * and control characters`
❌ Reserved names: `CON.jpg`, `PRN.jpg`, etc.
❌ Excessively long paths or filenames
❌ Paths with leading/trailing dots or spaces in filenames

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with Various URI Schemes**:
   - `file://` URIs from file pickers
   - `content://` URIs from media providers
   - Regular absolute paths

2. **Test with Space-Containing Paths**:
   - Folder names with spaces
   - Multiple nested folders with spaces
   - Ensure processing works end-to-end

3. **Test Auto-Fix Functionality**:
   - Verify automatic correction of minor path issues
   - Ensure fallback to original error when fixes fail

4. **Verify Privacy**:
   - Check that logs only show filenames, not full paths
   - Ensure sensitive path information is properly redacted

## Performance Impact
- Minimal: Added URI detection is O(1) string operations
- Auto-fix attempts only occur on validation failures
- No impact on successful validation cases
- Improved user experience by reducing false positives

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing valid paths continue to work
- More permissive validation reduces false rejections
- Existing error handling patterns preserved
- No breaking changes to API signatures
